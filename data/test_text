that sqrt e pi de morgan and many others worked hard at the problem but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by hamilton we now see the reason clearly the symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction but a multiplier and an angle in it the angles are confined to one plane hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra when the axis of the plane is made variable and this gives the answer to the first question double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry and this is why it has been found to be the natural analysis for alternating currents but de morgan never got this far he died with the belief that double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests when the study of mathematics revived at the university of cambridge so did the study of logic the moving spirit was whewell the master of trinity college whose principal writings were a history of the inductive sciences and philosophy of the inductive sciences doubtless de morgan was influenced in his logical investigations by whewell but other influential contemporaries were sir w hamilton of edinburgh and professor boole of cork de morgan s work on formal logic published in one eight four seven is principally remarkable for his development of the numerically definite syllogism the followers of aristotle say that from two particular propositions such as some m s are a s and some m s are b s nothing follows of necessity about the relation of the a s and b s but they go further and say in order that any relation about the a s and b s may follow of necessity the middle term must be taken universally in one of the premises de morgan pointed out that from most m s are a s and most m s are b s it follows of necessity that some a s are b s and he formulated the numerically definite syllogism which puts this principle in exact quantitative form suppose that the number of the m s is m of the m s that are a s is a and of the m s that are b s is b then there are at least a b m a s that are b s suppose that the number of souls on board a steamer was one zero zero zero that five zero zero were in the saloon and seven zero zero were lost it follows of necessity that at least seven zero zero five zero zero one zero zero zero that is two zero zero saloon passengers were lost this single principle suffices to prove the validity of all the aristotelian moods it is therefore a fundamental principle in necessary reasoning here then de morgan had made a great advance by introducing quantification of the terms at that time sir w hamilton was teaching at edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate and a correspondence sprang up however de morgan soon perceived that hamilton s quantification was of a different character that it meant for example substituting the two forms the whole of a is the whole of b and the whole of a is a part of b for the aristotelian form all a s are b s philosophers generally have a large share of intolerance they are too apt to think that they have got hold of the whole truth and that everything outside of their system is error hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the aristotelian arch as he phrased it although it must have been a curious arch which could stand two zero zero zero years without a keystone as a consequence he had no room for de morgan s innovations he accused de morgan of plagiarism and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the athen um and in the publications of the two writers the memoirs on logic which de morgan contributed to the transactions of the cambridge philosophical society subsequent to the publication of his book on formal logic are by far the most important contributions which he made to the science especially his fourth memoir in which he begins work in the broad field of the logic of relatives this is the true field for the logician of the twentieth century in which work of the greatest importance is to be done towards improving language and facilitating thinking processes which occur all the time in practical life identity and difference are the two relations which have been considered by the logician but there are many others equally deserving of study such as equality equivalence consanguinity affinity etc in the introduction to the budget of paradoxes de morgan explains what he means by the word a great many individuals ever since the rise of the mathematical method have each for himself attacked its direct and indirect consequences i shall call each of these persons a paradoxer and his system a paradox i use the word in the old sense a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion either in subject matter method or conclusion many of the things brought forward would now be called crackpots which is the nearest word we have to old paradox but there is this difference that by calling a thing a crackpot we mean to speak lightly of it which was not the necessary sense of paradox thus in the one six th century many spoke of the earth s motion as the paradox of copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem and some i think who even inclined towards it in the seventeenth century the depravation of meaning took place in england at least how can the sound paradoxer be distinguished from the false paradoxer de morgan supplies the following test the manner in which a paradoxer will show himself as to sense or nonsense will not depend upon what he maintains but upon whether he has or has not made a sufficient knowledge of what has been done by others especially as to the mode of doing it a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself new knowledge when to any purpose must come by contemplation of old knowledge in every matter which concerns thought mechanical contrivance sometimes not very often escapes this rule all the men who are now called discoverers in every matter ruled by thought have been men versed in the minds of their predecessors and learned in what had been before them there is not one exception i remember that just before the american association met at indianapolis in one eight nine zero the local newspapers heralded a great discovery which was to be laid before the assembled savants a young man living somewhere in the country had squared the circle while the meeting was in progress i observed a young man going about with a roll of paper in his hand he spoke to me and complained that the paper containing his discovery had not been received i asked him whether his object in presenting the paper was not to get it read printed and published so that everyone might inform himself of the result to all of which he assented readily but said i many men have worked at this question and their results have been tested fully and they are printed for the benefit of anyone who can read have you informed yourself of their results to this there was no assent but the sickly smile of the false paradoxer note de morgan did not say this how could he he died far before one eight nine zero rather as pointed out on the discussion page this paragraph and the rest of the article is copied verbatim from a lecture given in one nine one six the budget consists of a review of a large collection of paradoxical books which de morgan had accumulated in his own library partly by purchase at bookstands partly from books sent to him for review partly from books sent to him by the authors he gives the following classification squarers of the circle trisectors of the angle duplicators of the cube constructors of perpetual motion subverters of gravitation stagnators of the earth builders of the universe you will still find specimens of all these classes in the new world and in the new century de morgan gives his personal knowledge of paradoxers i suspect that i know more of the english class than any man in britain i never kept any reckoning but i know that one year with another and less of late years than in earlier time i have talked to more than five in each year giving more than a hundred and fifty specimens of this i am sure that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand nobody knows how they swarm except those to whom they naturally resort they are in all ranks and occupations of all ages and characters they are very earnest people and their purpose is bona fide the dissemination of their paradoxes a great many the mass indeed are illiterate and a great many waste their means and are in or approaching penury these discoverers despise one another a paradoxer to whom de morgan paid the compliment which achilles paid hector to drag him round the walls again and again was james smith a successful merchant of liverpool he found pi three frac his mode of reasoning was a curious caricature of the reductio ad absurdum of euclid he said let pi three frac and then showed that on that supposition every other value of pi must be absurd consequently pi three frac is the true value the following is a specimen of de morgan s dragging round the walls of troy mr smith continues to write me long letters to which he hints that i am to answer in his last of three one closely written sides of note paper he informs me with reference to my obstinate silence that though i think myself and am thought by others to be a mathematical goliath i have resolved to play the mathematical snail and keep within my shell a mathematical snail this cannot be the thing so called which regulates the striking of a clock for it would mean that i am to make mr smith sound the true time of day which i would by no means undertake upon a clock that gains one nine seconds odd in every hour by false quadrative value of pi but he ventures to tell me that pebbles from the sling of simple truth and common sense will ultimately crack my shell and put me hors de combat the confusion of images is amusing goliath turning himself into a snail to avoid pi three frac and james smith esq of the mersey dock board and put hors de combat by pebbles from a sling if goliath had crept into a snail shell david would have cracked the philistine with his foot there is something like modesty in the implication that the crack shell pebble has not yet taken effect it might have been thought that the slinger would by this time have been singing and thrice and one eighth i routed all my foes and thrice and one eighth i slew the slain in the region of pure mathematics de morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox but he was not so proficient in the field of physics his father in law was a paradoxer and his wife a paradoxer and in the opinion of the physical philosophers de morgan himself scarcely escaped his wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism table rapping table turning etc and de morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he knew some of the asserted facts believed others on testimony but did not pretend to know whether they were caused by spirits or had some unknown and unimagined origin from this alternative he left out ordinary material causes faraday delivered a lecture on spiritualism in which he laid it down that in the investigation we ought to set out with the idea of what is physically possible or impossible de morgan could not understand this
